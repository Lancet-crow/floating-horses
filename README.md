# Floating Horses

This is a simple mod that makes horses and skeleton horses float on water instead of sinking like a broken ship! Also works with modded horses :)

This mod only depends on [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) and additionally [Fzzy Config](https://modrinth.com/mod/fzzy-config) for the config screen to control swimming speeds of horses and skeleton horses.
